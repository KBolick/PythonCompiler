This is a translator that takes a parsed input tree and translates
it into a high-level intermediate representation (HIR).

Software dependencies:
	 racket
	 raco

Working:
	Everything except for multi-variable assignment, in some cases.

Broken:
	Multi-variable assignment, in some cases.

Manifest:
	pytrans.rkt		(the translator)
	lexer.rkt		(lexes python code into tokens)
	pyparse.rkt		(parses tokens into a parse tree)
	derivative-parsers.rkt	(derp for parsing)
	python-ast.grm.sx	(grammar file for parsing)
	tests			(directory full of tests.
				 Note: tests will only work while
				 connected to caprica server)
	Makefile  		(the make file)
	
	other files for testing (i.e. hir-header.rkt, sdiff.rkt)
